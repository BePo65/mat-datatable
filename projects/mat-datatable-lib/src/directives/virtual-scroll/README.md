This virtual scroll 'library' is a simplified version of the "diprokon/ng-table-virtual-scroll" library found at [https://github.com/diprokon/ng-table-virtual-scroll](https://github.com/diprokon/ng-table-virtual-scroll).

This library uses the MIT License.

The simplification make this 'library' a part of mat-datatable.

When virtual scroll gets part of angular material table, then this will be replaced by the functionality of the mat-table component.
